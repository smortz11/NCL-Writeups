# Cracking Encryption Walkthrough
RSA is the gold standard of encryption. It uses very large prime numbers in order to generate keys and encrypt text. However, if we have some of the numbers (as those provided to us in the intro), we can reverse engineer it and decrypt our message.

# Q1 - 15 Points
#### What is the value of p (the smaller prime)?

```bash
n = 1079
e = 43
c = 996 894 379 631 894 82 379 852 631 677 677 194 893
```

This is the hint given to us starting the room.

There are a few numbers we need to understand. Unfortunately, RSA is a tad math heavy, so buckle up.

| Symbol | Role     |
| ------ | -------- |
| N      | p * q :  |

#### Answer:
`An answer in backticks!`
