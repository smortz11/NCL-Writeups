# Writeup Guide

This guide explains how to submit your challenge writeups so they are consistent and easy to follow.

---

## **1. Folder Organization**

Each writeup should go into the folder corresponding to its **category**. Example categories might include:

- `Cryptography`
    
- `Open Source Intelligence`
    
- `Password Cracking`
    

If you wish to link to a specific, custom script, or an image, it should go into `/Scripts` or `/Images`

## 2. File Naming Convention

Each writeup file should follow this naming format:

```bash
RoomName (Difficulty) Initials.md
```

Example:

```bash
Meta (Easy) AS.md
```

## 3. Writeup Format

Each writeup should follow a clear structure like this:
1. Title
2. Brief Descripton of the challenge
3. Step-by-Step Walkthrough
4. Questions/Answers
5. Conclusion (if necessary)

See `TEMPLATE.md` for a ready-to-use example.

## 4. General Tips
- Use **code blocks** for commands and output (triple backtick)
- Include **links** to tools, wordlists, or references when necessary
