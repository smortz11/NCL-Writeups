# Advanced Web App Vulnerability Walkthrough
We are given a web app (who could've guessed). We are told that it holds a vulnerability and we are asked to replicate it!

# Q1 - 100 Points
#### What is the flag?

This one took a while as well as some hints.

I originally saw the text input on the site and assumed that there was an inject we would be performing. As it turns out, the site is vulnerable to XSS. As it turns out, this is not what it wants us to do!

Robots.txt is blocked and the javascript file I found in the page source did not seem very exciting. So instead, we are only left with a few more avenues to pursue. In my case, I sent an input then checked the `Network` tab of the dev tools (Ctrl + Shift + I).

Here, we can see the post request that is made after we submit an item. We can do some picking around in the headers and other info.

If we look at the request tab, we can see our input, which we expect. If we look at the response tab, we see something a tad off. We see a buffer where it looks like each letter was stored as a hex character.

Apparently, this buffer is known to have many vulnerabilities. We can also come to the conclusion that we are working with Node and Express based on headers seen earlier.

[Here](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) is the documentation for buffer. We can see a few deprecated commands that we can try to take advantage of:

```javascript
- [`new Buffer(array)`]
- [`new Buffer(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset[, length]])`]
- [`new Buffer(buffer)`]
- [`new Buffer(size)`]
- [`new Buffer(string[, encoding])`]
```

It is important to note that `new Buffer(size)` suggests a numerical value. This is what we need to do to get the flag. How were we supposed to inherently know that? I have no idea.

If we go to the dev tools once again, we can copy our request as a cURL request. We can hop over to a terminal, paste it, and alter the value stored in content. Doing so allows us to recover the flag when the number is large enough.
