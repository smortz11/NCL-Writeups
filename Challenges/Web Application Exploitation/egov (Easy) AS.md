# Q1 - 100 Points
#### What is the flag obtained from logging in?

With the thought that we cannot brute force the web form, we fall back to a few other methods of reconnaissance and exploitation. Let's begin by viewing the source code of the page:

Nothing here is inherently insecure (from my youthful eyes). Let's do some more poking around.

We may become interested in the cookies. Let us begin by opening the web developer tools (Ctrl + Shift + I). Here, we can navigate to the cookies stored by the site by navigating to the `Storage` tab.

We see a cookie named `admin` with a value of `false`. What happens if we make this true?

Edit the cookie to hold the value `true`, then enter any combination of credential into the form to get access to the admin dashboard. The flag will be right in front of you.
